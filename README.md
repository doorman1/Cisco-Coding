# Cisco-Coding
Just another networking geek. I'm a Cisco CCNP getting into the world of pen-testing.


I know how hard it is to get into Cisco IOS coding. Trust me I started from scratch. And there wasn't shit online. I was I could find example configs for different devices back in those days. So I had to create them all. I'm doing this so you don't have to. But please do understand the code behind it, otherwise you're just a script kiddie, not a Cisco programmer.
