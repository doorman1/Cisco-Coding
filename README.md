# Cisco-Coding

I know how hard it is to get into Cisco IOS coding. Trust me I started from scratch. And there wasn't anything online that was really useful. Yes, I could find default configs that didn't have anything cool added to it, but how did that help me? I wish I could have found example configs for different devices like these back in those days. So I ended up having to create them all. 

I'm doing this so you don't have to. But please do understand the code behind it, otherwise you're just a script kiddie, not a Cisco programmer. Learn from these scripts, but don't rely on them. Eventually you should be able to put anything written in these configs line by line through the Cisco command line (CLI) without having to look at these.

The cool thing about Cisco gear - it will never fail. Like never. By the way, I'm not talking about that Linksys-Cisco crap you buy in BestBuy, that's not real Cisco gear, that's Linksys stuff. But real Cisco gear will run for 20 years no problem without having to be rebooted. That's where it shines.

The shitty thing about Cisco gear - it's way over-priced and we all know it. Also it has an extremely high learning curve. Don't count on being able to do anything through the web interface, you better get comfortable with the command line. And another drawback, since they produce such stable gear, they usually aren't the ones introducing bleeding-edge gear to the market. They let others do that first, and let them work out all the bugs. Then they come out with their version of that product. This is enterprise grade stuff obviously. Not meant for your mom's simple network setup.


Enjoy!
